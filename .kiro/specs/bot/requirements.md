# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BriAI is a simple, real-time AI comedy bot that uses OpenAI's Realtime API with the official OpenAI Agents Python SDK. The system leverages RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner, and built-in WebRTC capabilities for seamless voice-based comedy interactions. It runs locally in a Docker container as a proof of concept, with the potential for future AWS ECS deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a comedy show host, I want to have real-time voice conversations with an AI comedy bot, so that I can create interactive entertainment experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the web interface THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC connection using OpenAI's built-in WebRTC classes
2. WHEN a user speaks into their microphone THEN the system SHALL process the audio through RealtimeSession with gpt-4o-realtime-preview
3. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL stream the audio response back using built-in audio handling
4. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context using RealtimeSession's built-in memory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to have a comedic personality, so that the interactions are entertaining and appropriate for comedy shows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RealtimeAgent is created THEN it SHALL be configured with comedy-focused instructions
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the AI SHALL maintain consistency in its comedy style through session memory
3. WHEN appropriate THEN the AI SHALL make callback references using RealtimeSession's conversation history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the system locally in Docker using the OpenAI Agents SDK, so that I can develop and test the comedy bot easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `docker build` THEN the system SHALL create a container with openai-agents-python SDK
2. WHEN running `docker run` THEN the system SHALL start RealtimeRunner with the comedy agent
3. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN users SHALL connect via OpenAI's WebRTC integration
4. WHEN the container starts THEN it SHALL initialize RealtimeSession with the provided OpenAI API key

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple web interface with built-in voice activity detection, so that I can have natural conversations with the comedy bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a simple UI with connection status
2. WHEN clicking "Start Conversation" THEN the system SHALL request microphone permissions and establish WebRTC
3. WHEN speaking THEN the system SHALL use server-side Voice Activity Detection for natural turn-taking
4. WHEN the session is active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time transcription feedback for debugging
