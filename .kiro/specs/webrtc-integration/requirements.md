# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current BriAI implementation has a critical bug where sessions are created but WebRTC audio communication is not working. Users can start conversations but cannot hear the AI responses or have their voice properly processed. This fix will implement the missing WebRTC integration that should have been part of the original bot implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing BriAI bot to actually work for voice conversations, so that the basic functionality that was supposed to be implemented is functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL establish a working WebRTC connection that enables actual audio communication
2. WHEN a user speaks THEN their audio SHALL be properly transmitted and processed by the OpenAI Realtime API
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the audio response SHALL be audible through the user's speakers
4. WHEN the conversation is active THEN real-time bidirectional voice communication SHALL work as originally intended

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the broken WebRTC implementation using the correct OpenAI patterns, so that the bot works as originally designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing the WebRTC integration THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI's correct WebRTC implementation patterns
2. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL properly connect the frontend WebRTC to the backend RealtimeSession
3. WHEN handling audio streams THEN the system SHALL use the proper audio formats and WebRTC configuration for OpenAI Realtime API
4. WHEN managing sessions THEN the WebRTC connection SHALL be properly integrated with the existing RealtimeSession lifecycle

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the connection status and audio processing, so that I understand when the system is listening and responding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebRTC is connecting THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connection status indicators
2. WHEN audio is being processed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about listening/speaking states
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN the conversation is active THEN the system SHALL show real-time transcription for transparency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the WebRTC connection to work reliably across different browsers and network conditions, so that I can use BriAI consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using supported browsers THEN the WebRTC connection SHALL establish successfully
2. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
3. WHEN audio quality degrades THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN the session ends THEN all WebRTC resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
