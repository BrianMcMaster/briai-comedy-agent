# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update backend to use official OpenAI Python SDK Realtime API
  - Replace openai-agents-python with official openai Python SDK realtime support
  - Update backend to use client.beta.realtime.connect() for WebSocket connections
  - Remove dependency on separate agents SDK in favor of official SDK
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Implement WebSocket proxy for frontend-to-OpenAI connection
  - Create WebSocket endpoint in backend that proxies between frontend and OpenAI Realtime API
  - Use AsyncOpenAI client.beta.realtime.connect() to establish OpenAI connection
  - Forward WebSocket messages bidirectionally between frontend and OpenAI
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Update frontend to use WebSocket connection for audio streaming
  - Replace HTTP session creation with WebSocket connection to backend proxy
  - Implement proper audio capture and streaming to WebSocket
  - Add audio playback handling for incoming audio responses from OpenAI
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Implement bidirectional audio communication through WebSocket
  - Send user audio data from frontend to backend via WebSocket
  - Forward audio to OpenAI Realtime API and stream responses back to frontend
  - Handle conversation events (speech detection, transcription, audio responses)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 5. Add connection status and error handling
  - Update frontend to show proper WebSocket connection status
  - Add error handling for WebSocket connection failures and recovery
  - Implement proper cleanup when conversation is stopped
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
- [x] 6. Test and validate complete conversation flow
  - Test that users can speak and hear AI responses in real-time
  - Verify conversation continues until stop button is pressed
  - Test connection recovery and error scenarios
  - Remove any unused code from previous broken implementation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
